## 12/5/2024 - Initial Brainstorm

### Precedents

Roll and Writes!

- Next Stop London -> card flipping stops
- Dinosaur Island: Rawr’n Write
- That’s So Clever
- Pizza Party Dice

Press Your Luck
- Let’s Dig for Treasure
- Pass the Pigs
- Deep Sea Adventure
  
### Questions

What does a Spots + Dig for Treasure game look like?

- Could be cool to steamroll from a few basic dice & options to more possibilities
- Q: How does rolling dice to place on cards feel?
- Q: Possible theme?

  
## 12/9/2024 - Testing with Spots Cards

Basic Mechanics:

- Rolling 4 dice
- If you cannot place at least 1 die you bust
- Placing at least 1 die allows all the unplaced dice to be rerolled
- Filling up a card completely returns those dice to your pool

### Ideas
- Actually pretty fun?
- Could be combined with collecting cards to build sets? (Like Tucano or Sushi Go)
- Could have card combos like milk and cookies
- Could have card actions and other effects
- Could give you additional dice

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/12-9-24_2.jpg" width="50%">


### Spots Card Distribution:
- 1 die: 1 card
- 2 dice: 15 cards
- 3 dice: 15 cards
- 4 dice: 1 card


## 12/12/2024 - Generating Cards

- 6 cards with 1 die on them (may want to have x2 of these)
	- 1-6
- 21 unique cards with 2 dice on them (including repeats)
	- (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,2) (2,3) etc.
- 20 unique cards with 3 dice on them (excluding repeats)
	- (1,2,3) (1,2,4) (1,2,5) (1,2,6) (1,3,4) etc.

This gives us 53 cards as a starting place 
-> Filled out a spreadsheet with the card distribution and details

Robot theme?!

## 12/16/2024 - Actual Card Test

Feels pretty solid to roll and conveyor cards

Now we add the Daily Quota
- 2s and 3s get a quota color
- 1s and the double 1,1 are colorless for now
	- Could be additional abilities or something on these

Q: What does a tie quota mean?
- Maybe it’s tracked at the end of every day and builds to a game end point bonus

### Next
- Start thinking about grey card abilities
- And how pairs/combos of robot cards might work (milk and cookies style)
- Maybe make a printable quota tracker?

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/12-16-24_1.jpg" width="50%">

## 12/19/2024 - Pairs, Combos, and Card Abilities

How should combos be distributed?
- Milk and Cookies (more common)
- Chips and Salsa (more rare)

Ability Ideas:
- Reroll dice
- Shuffle robots
- Replace robots
- Swap card order
- Save a card from being burned (like a conveyor belt stop)

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/12-19-24_1.jpg" width="50%">

Maybe 1 die cards have abilities and are worth zero points?

Or 1 die cards keep being worth 1 point but when scored remain in front like the loyal dog and their action can be used on a subsequent turn?


## 12/31/2024 - Playtest Sesh

Playtested day one of the game with quota types, pairs and single card abilities
- 22 v. 16 
- Pairs and single cards were collected by both players
	- With matching and unmatched pairs
- Not sure if the ability cards have to be ‘spent’ to be used
	- Is it more of a valuable resource to be used sparingly?
- Daily quota wasn’t in the lead for a type that either player had
	- At the end of the three days if it is the wrong type probably the points go to no one?

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/12-31-25_1.png" width="50%">

How should the round end?
- Could have a STOP card that gets shuffled in to a certain portion of the deck per day
	- Would probably have to vary depending on the number of people playing


## 1/6/2025 - Multiplayer Conveyor Update

What would it look like for the play to be more ‘simultaneous’ (whatever that means)
- With each player taking a slot along the conveyor
- Each section of the conveyor could have a handful of cards and whatever isn’t fixed, moves on to the next person down the line
- With the player order swapping per day


### Playtest!
- It actually felt pretty good!

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/1-6-25_1.png" width="50%">

- Starting play with the player closes to the burn pile
- Having sections to the conveyor with stuff moving down the line felt more conveyor belt-y

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/1-6-25_2.png" width="50%">

- Adjusted the Swap & Shuffle to allow players to switch the position of 2 cards on the line (so long as one of them was in front of that player) 
	- Also applies to the ‘End of Day’ card which was fun
	- Could lead to some fun shenanigans
- Round should automatically end when the End of Day card is burned or the conveyor cannot be fully refilled with bots while the End of Day card is on the line
- Could have an ability to swap a bot in front of you with one from the burn pile 👀
	- Maybe just have 1 or 2 of these in the whole deck though
 
<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/1-6-25_3.jpg" width="50%">


### To Do:
Create a player mat for each player’s section of the belt with:
- Slots for the 3 cards currently on the belt
- A section below that for bots they have fixed this turn
- A pile for fixed bots from the entire round
- Point tracker for tracking points between rounds
- Cute styling like this is a mechanics desk 

Add a zero to the quota tracker lol


## 1/9/2025 - Player Mat Playtest

Feels really nice with the conveyor player mats to delineate the play space

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/1-9-25_1.jpg" width="30%">
<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/1-9-25_2.jpg" width="30%">

Q: What if everyone rolled for their section of the conveyor simultaneously?

<b>Pros</b>
- Game goes faster
- Fun chaos of everyone rolling dice simultaneously

<b>Cons</b>
- Less player investment for what other people are doing
- Push your luck is usually combined with spectatorship

Need to specify that the Swap action happens after the rolling phase

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/1-9-25_3.jpg" width="50%">

Q: What if <i>only</i> the first person to clear their conveyor line gets a bonus?
- Makes it more frantic
- Even more incentive to push your luck and go for all 3
- 5 dice instead of 4
- Ended up being much less strategic
- Fun and frantic but waaay more busts
- Loses some of the original strategy

Could be good to keep 4 dice and give a bonus to any/all player who complete their conveyor line completely 

### To Do:
- Think about asset styling 
- Work on some concepts for non-standard dice



## 1/23/2025 - Dice, Probability, Questions, Oh My!
 
Q: What if the dice had non-uniform probability distributions?
- Could there be a pool of dice you draft from
- Different types of dice?
- Robot types had different number preferences

Q: Should tools be separated from the robot cards?
- Could have a separate pile that is getting pulled from
- Dice you place there do no refresh back to you during the round
- Build up in a little desk tool box

Q: How do we give the player more agency in their robot selection?
- Double sided robot cards?!
	- Each robot card could have more than one type
- Simplify the Milk and Cookies pairs to 1 pair type

### To Do:
- Add multi color robot types to spreadsheet
- Playtest separate tool cards



## 1/27/2025 - Card Updates & Tools Implementation
 
- Added a second color type to the cards in the spreadsheet
- Updated the pairs to be simpler
	- Added a new all or nothing pair

### Playtest!
- Conveyor mechanic is still enjoyable
- EOD should probably not be swappable
- Tool slot feels really good
	- It’s fun to always have access to it
- Still maybe need more incentive to clear your full line
	- +1 point? Is that enough 

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/1-27-25_1.png" width="50%">

### To Do:
- Update Cards with second planned color
- Playtest to see if the daily quota makes sense again


## 1/31/2025 - Tools & Dice

### Playtest!
M: 21 points - 5b, 1r

Z: 23 points - 4y, 2r, 2g

- We may want to be more specific with the placement of the ‘end of day’ card in the deck’
- Paired cards probably shouldn’t have a color
	- May need to add more 2 dice cards
- Daily quota is still pretty close in numbers
	- Could roll a quota die per round…
	- Daily AND weekly quota?
- That’s pretty clever die that allows you to take something someone else has rolled?

- Maybe tools are separate from the cards?
	- Tool die?
		- Per round?
		- Per turn? Up to a max of 3
	- If tools stay as cards they could have different die requirements: 1s & 2s, <3, etc.

- Could do something with the 1 die cards where having the most of them is worth points instead of them individually

### To Do:
- Think about tool dice options
- Redistribute colors to the new set of cards
	- And print them?

## 2/3/2025 - Card Reprint

- Updated the card distribution and reprinted some of them!

### Playtest!
- Distributed the EOD card into a set of 3 cards below ~18 cards
	- 2 players x 3 cards x 3 rounds = 18
- Rolling the tool die each turn is very fun
- Having the single die cards back in the deck speeds the game back up and felt really good!

M: 9 points - 1R, 1G
- 3 singles

Z: 15 points - 1R, 1G, 1Y
- 5 singles

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/2-3-25_1.png" width="50%">

- Curious to play through more than 1 round and see how the single cards getting removed from the deck overtime feels


## 2/6/2025 - Review Playtest
- Want to play 2 rounds of the game as is and see how the gameplay feels and the points are distributed

### Playtest!
#### Round 1

Z: 10pt - 0R 0Y 1G 1B - 2 singles - 1 bonus

M: 6pt - 0R 0Y 0G 0B - 2 singles - 1 bonus

- Could be interesting if the singles AND the pairs stay out between rounds

#### Round 2

Z: 7pt - 3R 0Y 0G 0B - 1 singles - 0 bonus

M: 10pt - 0R 0Y 0G 1B - 3 singles - 2 bonus

#### Totals:

Z: 17pt - 3 singles - 1 bonus - Quota Bonus

M: 17pt - 5 singles - 3 bonus

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/2-6-25_1.png" width="50%">

- Not as much choice for choosing robots by color or pair
- Maybe reduce singles back down to 12 in the deck?

## 2/10/2025 - Tool Dice Playtest
- EOD card distributed into 3 cards below (# Players + 1) x 3 cards

### Playtest!

#### Round 1

Z: 8pt - 0R 1Y 0G 0B - 1A & 2B	0 singles - 0 bonus

M: 8pt - 2R 0Y 0G 1B - 0A & 0B	1 singles - 0 bonus

- Wild tool die shouldn’t return dice during that turn to keep rerolling
- When should points be scored for pairs and bonuses?

#### Round 2

Z: 11pt - 0R 2Y 0G 0B - 2A & 1B - 3 singles - 1 bonus

M: 14pt - 0R 1Y 0G 0B - 0A & 1B - 0 singles - 0 bonus

#### Totals:

Z: 19pt - 3A & 3B - 3 singles - 1 bonus = 26pt + Quota Bonus + Singles Bonus

M: 22pt - 0A & 1B - 1 singles - 0 bonus = 22pts

- Shuffle feels good for player agency
- Love the customized tool dice :)

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/2-10-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

- Additional conveyor spot not in front of a player was nice
- Color on robots doesn’t feel as impactful
	- Could be worth removing?
- Keeping the pairs between rounds is nice
- It might be nice to have something that ramps up each round to make the game have a more distinct progression
	- Each round you add a die?
	- Personal dice that have different distributions?
	- Worth trying for next time


## 2/13/2025 - Types or No Types Playtest
- What if there weren’t any color types on robots?

### Playtest!
- Seems like it mostly reduces the reason to shuffle cards around…

#### Round 1

Z: 9pt | 0A & 0B | 1 singles | 0 bonus

M: 10pt | 0A & 1B | 1 singles | 0 bonus

- Maybe instead of one of the rerolls, there should be a tool that saves you from busting if you roll incorrectly and allows you to walk away with what you’ve already fixed
- Color types are probably worth keeping
	- What if EVERY card had a color instead

#### Specialty Dice!
- The idea being that each round you specialize in a certain way of fixing robots, so you either replace or are adding specialty dice to your rolling pool
- Need to brainstorm more specialty dice here
	- Oops all 4s where there are 5 sides of 4 and 1 side of nothing XD
- Try out some of these mixed in with normal dice next time


## 2/18/2025 - Specialty Dice Playtest Pt. 1
- Let’s see how 4 normal dice + 1 specialty die feels in a round

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/2-18-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

### Playtest!
- Quite fast with more stuff being cleared (though it has a round 1 distribution of 1s cards)

#### Round 1

Z: 8pt | 0A & 1B | 1 singles | 0 bonus

M: 16pt | 0A & 0B | 2 singles | 2 bonus

4R, 2Y, 1G, 1B

- Need to playtest more for specialty dice distribution over each round
	- Round 1: 4 normal dice
	- Round 2: 4 normal dice + 1 specialty die
	- Round 3: 4 normal dice + 2 specialty dice?



## 2/21/2025 - Specialty Dice Playtest Pt. 2
- Let’s see how 4 normal dice + 1 specialty die and then + 2 specialty dice feel

### Playtest!
- 6 pointer might be too powerful… needs 4 dice?

#### Round “2”

Z: 10pt | 0A & 0B | 2 singles | 1 bonus

M: 10pt | 0A & 0B | 1 singles | 0 bonus

3R, 1Y, 1G, 1B

#### Round “3”

Z: 12pt | 0A & 0B | 4 singles | 2 bonus

M: 17pt | 1A & 2B | 0 singles | 1 bonus

3R, 2Y, 2G, 1B

#### Totals

Z: 22pt + singles + quota + 3 bonus = 33pt 

M: 27pt	+ 1 pairs + 1 bonus = 30pt

- Maybe singles cards have different #s on the back of the cards you can choose between
- Almost every card should have 2 color options

### To Do:
- Add color to the single die cards
- Make the additional specialty dice
- Playtest with drafting specialty dice from the person with the lowest points up


## 2/24/2025 - Double Sided Singles
- Adding a second side to the single die cards

### Playtest!

#### Round “2”
Z: 9pt | 0A & 0B & 1Z | 2 singles | 2 bonus
M: 4pt | 1A & 0B & 0Z | 2 singles | 1 bonus

3R, 1Y, 2G, 3B

- Double sided cards feel a bit annoying to swap since people need to look at both sides

#### Round “3”
Z: 6pt | 1A & 1B | 2 singles | 2 bonus

M: 14pt | 1A & 0B | 0 singles | 2 bonus

3R, 3Y, 2G, 2B

#### Totals
Z: 19pt + 1 pairs + singles = 24pt 

M: 21pt + quota = 27pt

6R, 4Y, 2G, 2B

- Cleared ⅞ lines…
- Should there be 4 die cards


## 2/24/2025 - 3 Dice?
- What if we dropped down to only 3 normal dice and added specialty dice as we went

### Playtest!
- Feels REAL tough with only 3 dice
- There is a distinct disadvantage to the player who starts the first round - they get more time with the end of day card

#### Round 1

Z: 3pt | 0A & 0B | 2 singles | 1 clears

M: 12pt | 1A & 0B | 0 singles | 0 clears

4R, 1Y, 0G, 1B

- Could be good to replace 6 of the 1 die cards with 4 dice cards 👀
- And go back to rolling 4 dice to start

#### Round 2

Z: 10pt	| 0A & 0B | 2 singles | 1 clears

M: 6pt | 1A & 0B | 1 singles| 0 clears

4R, 3Y, 2G, 1B

- Maybe there are more types of tools?


## 3/3/2025 - Card Brainstorm

- New more colorful specialty dice!

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/3-3-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

### Brainstorm ideas:
- Basically all cards should just have 1 color type
- Maybe at the start of your turn you can always burn 1 of your cards and replace it blindly from the top of the deck
- Instead of assigning each player a quota color, each day you draw a few quota requests that require certain cards to be fixed for a small bonus


## 3/6/2025 - 4 Dice Card Playtest
- What if the Quota Requests were like, 1 Red & 2 Yellow 
- Could be interesting to try out having the option to burn a card at the start of your turn
- Trying out some robot visuals:

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/3-6-25_1.jpg" width="25%">

### Playtest!
- Tool idea: conveyor shift where all the cards move 1 slot to the right or left
- Burning each round makes things move a bit faster if pulling from the regular deck

#### Round 1
Z: 8pt | 0A & 0B | 1 singles | 0 clears

M: 7pt | 0A & 2B | 1 singles | 1 clears

0R, 4Y, 1G, 2B

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/3-6-25_2.jpg" width="50%">


- The conveyor shouldn't clear between rounds
- Burn & swap ability could swap in the EOD which could be bad for balance… 
	- Additional pile of robot cards to swap in for this?



## 3/14/2025 - Quota Requests Revamped

- When can you grab a quota? - End of turn
- Can you fill multiple in one turn? - Yes

### Quota Types:
- Color types (R, R, Y)
- Die Types (1, 1, 1)
- Tool Dice? (Shuffle Shuffle)

- When you burn cards at the start of your turn, where does that get replenished from? 
- Might make sense if there is a separate robot deck that isn’t managing the round length

### Tool Die Ideas:
- Flip tool: you can flip a die option 180 to the other side
- Bust saver: you can stop a bust from happening and walk away
- Conveyor crank: shifts the entire conveyor one to the right or left

## 3/17/2025 - Quota Card Playtest
- Made some quota cards physically to play with

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/3-17-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

### Playtest:
- Love having the macro goal of the quota cards to be looking at/building towards
- Could be useful to have card info at the top of the robot cards so you can stack them slightly offset and see what quotas you are close to
- Should fixed robots count towards quotas on subsequent days?
- Should everything be scored at the end?
- Scoring cards could be a fun way to track everything throughout the game 🤔

#### Round 1
Z: 10pt | 1 quota | 1A & 0B | 1 singles | 0 clears

M: 9pt | 0 quota | 1A & 1B | 1 singles | 1 clears

- Need to playtest through a full game to start to answer the scoring questions


## 3/19/2025 - Full Game Playtest

Let’s play through 3 full rounds of the game and see how it feels:

- What should the order of tool dice, burning and swapping be?
- Could the 2, 2, 2 quota be filled by 2 cards where one of them has two 2s
- This is definitely a better version of the quotas (compared to just amount of color throughout the game)
- Once you have 3 tool dice in front of you the next turn you should be able to reroll one of yours

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/3-19-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

### End of Game
Z: 72pt: 5 quota | 2A 1B 2Z | 5 singles | 5 clears

I: 58pt: 5 quota | 4A 3B 0Z | 4 singles | 4 clears

- Game felt too long
- Best part was definitely the specialty dice
- Quotas were kind of gathered passively, just by getting robots over time
- Clearing the board is VERY satisfying
- Could have the EOD at a set number of rounds or move down the conveyor each round


## 3/21/2025 - Simplifying the Conveyor

How would the conveyor feel if it was simplified down to just like 4 or 6 slots that were shared

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/3-21-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

- What if the rounds were limited to just like 1 or 2 turns per?
	- So the whole game took place over the course of 6 rounds


## 3/24/2025 - 6 Round Playtest

- Definitely feels more concise with just the 2 turns per round
- Might need the quotas to be more difficult to get
	- Could include 4 robot quotas?
- No more As & Bs
	- It just hasn’t panned out to be fun or impactful

### End of game scores:
Z:  24 pts | 4 quotas | 1 clear | 1 A & 1 B | 3 singles

M: 37 pts | 4 quotas | 2 clears | 1A & 0B | 3 singles


## 4/7/2025 - Concept Meeting

- Ordered custom dice with icons on each of the faces instead of numbers

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/4-7-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

- Now need to get the cards updated…
- Could be fun to have the different types of cards have different theming
	- Singles are little junk fixes
	- 2s could be some sort of wild type or blueprint?



## 4/11/2025 - 2s As Wild Playtest

- What if 2s didn’t have one of the 4 quota colors but instead required two of them to fulfil a quota color request
- Also singles have no color

**insert Matt and Zayna playtesting this idea*

- Seemed good, like the long term play was more important 
- Will be interesting to combine with further game adjustments


## 4/14/2025 - Tool Die Ideation

- What if the shuffle tool was pulling from the trash instead
- Switch the wild tool out for a duplication tool
	- Where you can use it as though you rolled multiple of something and it stands in for a placeable die 1 time
- Claw tool where you can move or? remove a placed die

So instead the new distribution looks like:

1. Reroll
2. Reroll
3. Trash Swap
4. Bust Saver
5. Duplicator
6. Claw

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/4-14-25_1.jpg" width="50%">


## 4/22/2025 - New Card Playtest

- Not playing with specialty dice, just 3 rounds of having the starting standard 4

**insert Matt and Zayna playtesting this idea*

- Icons were nice to have on cards!
- Question about the dupe die -> can it also save you from a bust?
	- Probably not, since it can only be used after placing a die you’ve just rolled
- Having the back up of 2 gray cards to fill quotas was good to make them not impossible to get
- The new claw and dupe die did some fun logic with placing stuff
- Didn’t get to see the trash or bust save come into play this game

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/4-22-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

### End of game scores:
Z: 22 pts | 1 quota | singles bonus

M: 21 pts | 1 quota | 1 clear bonus

### To Dos:
- Add 2 card quotas (and maybe some 4s?)
- Make custom specialty dice

## 4/24/2025 - All Custom Icons Playtest

- Trashcan tool die is pretty fun, allows for some control over what you have been dealt
- Should quotas devalue over time?
	- Like the longer it has been waiting to be filled the less it is worth? 
	- May just over complicate things…
- Choosing specialty dice feels more confusing the second time, you’re trying to balance a mixture of the two and it feels sort of like I don’t know how to make a good decision
- Maybe extra unused tool dice at the end of the game get you +1 point per die
	- (Just in case you couldn’t use the tool or didn’t want to)

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/4-24-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

### End of game scores:
M: 48 pts (3 quotas + 2 clears + singles bonus)

Z: 40 pts (3 quotas)

- The game still feels a little long… 
- Maybe at the end of the day it’s just 2 days of 2 rounds and then 1 final bonanza round with something wild or crazy


## 4/25/2025 - 2 Days Playtest
- What if it was just 2 days of 2 rounds:

### End of game scores:
Z: 19 pts (1x 3pt quota + 1x clear bonus)

M: 22 pts (1x 2pt quota)

- Tied with 1 single each
- Feels like it would be nice if the game culminated in a final round…
- Framing the game as a work week could be fun like M-F
	- Should distribute the additional mechanics throughout the week
		- M: Start
		- Tue: +1 quota
		- W: + Specialty Dice
		- Th: +1 quota
		- F: TGIF?


## 4/28/2025 - Work Week Playtest
- Bust save probably shouldn’t allow you to reroll, just end your turn and keep your bots
- Maybe specialty dice are given randomly? (instead of choosing)

I: 37 pts + Singles Bonus (3 quotas)

Z: 26 pts (2 quotas)

- Game length felt pretty good
- 4 Quotas out at a time was probably too many
- Specialty Dice should also probably all be 50/50s
- Could probably reduce the points on cards down by 1

## 5/2/2025 - Ideation
- Add a card to the conveyor as a day modification?
- Multiple conveyor belts??
	- Clearing any 1 gets you the clear bonus

Q: What if it was Dorf-ified
- Progression that unlocks different work week mechanics
	- Quotas
	- Specialty Dice
	- Tool Dice
- Training Week could be just like 3 days
- Week 1 introduces quotas
- Week 2 introduces specialty dice
- Week 3 ?


## 5/5/2025 - Playtest
- Additional Quota on Day 2 feels a little odd
- Trying it out with 3 cards

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/5-5-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

Z: 25 pts (2 quotas) + singles bonus (1 per) = 27 pts

M: 33 pts (3 quotas) + clear bonus (1) = 34 pts

- Liked each day giving you something new
- Friday round would be fun if shorter
	- Could be fun if it was a broken conveyor that chucks your bots off the end
	- Or against a timer?
- Could explore an either or face of the dice


## 5/8/2025 - Quick Check In
- Playtest with the 1s and 2s deck separate from a 3s deck
	- Rounds are real fast
 	- Chance of busting is higher
- Should playtest with additional conveyor belts

## 5/12/2025 - Playtest
- 1s and 2s deck -> Round 1&2
- 2s & 3s deck -> Round 3&4
- 4s deck -> Round 5
	- Doesn’t really work since it’s too hard to get your die back off the cards
- Try multi-belt playtest
- Maybe also shuffling into the deck?

## 5/29/2025 - Playtest & Rules Review
- Tried the multiple conveyor belts with 3 slots for 1s & 2s, 2 slots for 2s & 3s and 1 slot for 4s
	 - Maybe a tad long/overwhelming?

- What if every time you rolled the conveyor moves?
- Still need to make all the possible combos of specialty dice 50/50s


## 6/2/2025 - Horizontal Playtest
- Tried adding conveyor lines down into one horizontal belt

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/6-2-25_1.jpg" width="50%">

M: 26 pts + 5 quotas + Singles Bonus

Z: 26 pts + 6 quotas + Clear Bonus

- Liked this a lot
- Having the 1s and 2s deck and then the 3s and then the 4s was nice
- Might be long for a 4 player game?
- Friday speed round was actually kind of fun?
- Need to test this more

## 6/5/2025 - Friday Bonanza Playtest
- Robots acquired:
	- 2/2/3
	- 3/3
	- 3/3/1
	- 2/3/3/4
- Actually pretty fun/addicting

## 6/10/2025 - 3 Player Playtest
- Game Name Ideas:
	- Rollbots
	- Roll & Repair

New work week schedule:

**Playtest Thoughts**
- Quotas should probably be fixed and start at day 1 (Weekly Quotas)
	- Should the # of players = # of quotas?

AJ: 32 pts (2 quotas + 2 clears)

I: 34 pts (1 quota + 2 clears) + shared single bonus

Z: 38 pts (2 quotas + 1 clear) + shared single bonus
