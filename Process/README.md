## 12/5/2024 - Initial Brainstorm

### Precedents

Roll and Writes!

- Next Stop London -> card flipping stops
- Dinosaur Island: Rawr’n Write
- That’s So Clever
- Pizza Party Dice

Press Your Luck
- Let’s Dig for Treasure
- Pass the Pigs
- Deep Sea Adventure
  
### Questions

What does a Spots + Dig for Treasure game look like?

- Could be cool to steamroll from a few basic dice & options to more possibilities
- Q: How does rolling dice to place on cards feel?
- Q: Possible theme?

  
## 12/9/2024 - Testing with Spots Cards

Basic Mechanics:

- Rolling 4 dice
- If you cannot place at least 1 die you bust
- Placing at least 1 die allows all the unplaced dice to be rerolled
- Filling up a card completely returns those dice to your pool
  
### Ideas
- Actually pretty fun?
- Could be combined with collecting cards to build sets? (Like Tucano or Sushi Go)
- Could have card combos like milk and cookies
- Could have card actions and other effects
- Could give you additional dice

### Spots Card Distribution:
- 1 die: 1 card
- 2 dice: 15 cards
- 3 dice: 15 cards
- 4 dice: 1 card


## 12/12/2024 - Generating Cards

- 6 cards with 1 die on them (may want to have x2 of these)
	- 1-6
- 21 unique cards with 2 dice on them (including repeats)
	- (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,2) (2,3) etc.
- 20 unique cards with 3 dice on them (excluding repeats)
	- (1,2,3) (1,2,4) (1,2,5) (1,2,6) (1,3,4) etc.

This gives us 53 cards as a starting place 
-> Filled out a spreadsheet with the card distribution and details

Robot theme?!


## 12/16/2024 - Actual Card Test

Feels pretty solid to roll and conveyor cards

Now we add the Daily Quota
- 2s and 3s get a quota color
- 1s and the double 1,1 are colorless for now
	- Could be additional abilities or something on these

Q: What does a tie quota mean?
- Maybe it’s tracked at the end of every day and builds to a game end point bonus

### Next
- Start thinking about grey card abilities
- And how pairs/combos of robot cards might work (milk and cookies style)
- Maybe make a printable quota tracker?

## 12/19/2024 - Pairs, Combos, and Card Abilities

How should combos be distributed?
- Milk and Cookies (more common)
- Chips and Salsa (more rare)

Ability Ideas:
- Reroll dice
- Shuffle robots
- Replace robots
- Swap card order
- Save a card from being burned (like a conveyor belt stop)
  

Maybe 1 die cards have abilities and are worth zero points?

Or 1 die cards keep being worth 1 point but when scored remain in front like the loyal dog and their action can be used on a subsequent turn?
