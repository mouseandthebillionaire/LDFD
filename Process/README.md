## 12/5/2024 - Initial Brainstorm

### Precedents

Roll and Writes!

- Next Stop London -> card flipping stops
- Dinosaur Island: Rawrâ€™n Write
- Thatâ€™s So Clever
- Pizza Party Dice

Press Your Luck
- Letâ€™s Dig for Treasure
- Pass the Pigs
- Deep Sea Adventure
  
### Questions

What does a Spots + Dig for Treasure game look like?

- Could be cool to steamroll from a few basic dice & options to more possibilities
- Q: How does rolling dice to place on cards feel?
- Q: Possible theme?

  
## 12/9/2024 - Testing with Spots Cards

Basic Mechanics:

- Rolling 4 dice
- If you cannot place at least 1 die you bust
- Placing at least 1 die allows all the unplaced dice to be rerolled
- Filling up a card completely returns those dice to your pool

### Ideas
- Actually pretty fun?
- Could be combined with collecting cards to build sets? (Like Tucano or Sushi Go)
- Could have card combos like milk and cookies
- Could have card actions and other effects
- Could give you additional dice

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ConveyorSketch.jpg" width="50%">


### Spots Card Distribution:
- 1 die: 1 card
- 2 dice: 15 cards
- 3 dice: 15 cards
- 4 dice: 1 card


## 12/12/2024 - Generating Cards

- 6 cards with 1 die on them (may want to have x2 of these)
	- 1-6
- 21 unique cards with 2 dice on them (including repeats)
	- (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (2,2) (2,3) etc.
- 20 unique cards with 3 dice on them (excluding repeats)
	- (1,2,3) (1,2,4) (1,2,5) (1,2,6) (1,3,4) etc.

This gives us 53 cards as a starting placeÂ 
-> Filled out a spreadsheet with the card distribution and details

Robot theme?!

## 12/16/2024 - Actual Card Test

Feels pretty solid to roll and conveyor cards

Now we add the Daily Quota
- 2s and 3s get a quota color
- 1s and the double 1,1 are colorless for now
	- Could be additional abilities or something on these

Q: What does a tie quota mean?
- Maybe itâ€™s tracked at the end of every day and builds to a game end point bonus

### Next
- Start thinking about grey card abilities
- And how pairs/combos of robot cards might work (milk and cookies style)
- Maybe make a printable quota tracker?

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/QuotaTrackerSketch.jpg" width="50%">

## 12/19/2024 - Pairs, Combos, and Card Abilities

How should combos be distributed?
- Milk and Cookies (more common)
- Chips and Salsa (more rare)

Ability Ideas:
- Reroll dice
- Shuffle robots
- Replace robots
- Swap card order
- Save a card from being burned (like a conveyor belt stop)

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ConveyorSetup.jpg" width="50%">

Maybe 1 die cards have abilities and are worth zero points?

Or 1 die cards keep being worth 1 point but when scored remain in front like the loyal dog and their action can be used on a subsequent turn?


## 12/31/2024 - Playtest Sesh

Playtested day one of the game with quota types, pairs and single card abilities
- 22 v. 16 
- Pairs and single cards were collected by both players
	- With matching and unmatched pairs
- Not sure if the ability cards have to be â€˜spentâ€™ to be used
	- Is it more of a valuable resource to be used sparingly?
- Daily quota wasnâ€™t in the lead for a type that either player had
	- At the end of the three days if it is the wrong type probably the points go to no one?

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ZoomPlaytest.png" width="50%">

How should the round end?
- Could have a STOP card that gets shuffled in to a certain portion of the deck per day
	- Would probably have to vary depending on the number of people playing


## 1/6/2025 - Multiplayer Conveyor Update

What would it look like for the play to be more â€˜simultaneousâ€™ (whatever that means)
- With each player taking a slot along the conveyor
- Each section of the conveyor could have a handful of cards and whatever isnâ€™t fixed, moves on to the next person down the line
- With the player order swapping per day


### Playtest!
- It actually felt pretty good!

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ZoomPlaytestConveyorStart.png" width="50%">

- Starting play with the player closes to the burn pile
- Having sections to the conveyor with stuff moving down the line felt more conveyor belt-y

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ZoomPlaytestConveyorEnd.png" width="50%">

- Adjusted the Swap & Shuffle to allow players to switch the position of 2 cards on the line (so long as one of them was in front of that player) 
	- Also applies to the â€˜End of Dayâ€™ card which was fun
	- Could lead to some fun shenanigans
- Round should automatically end when the End of Day card is burned or the conveyor cannot be fully refilled with bots while the End of Day card is on the line
- Could have an ability to swap a bot in front of you with one from the burn pile ðŸ‘€
	- Maybe just have 1 or 2 of these in the whole deck though
 
<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/QuotaEndOfGame.jpg" width="50%">


### To Do:
Create a player mat for each playerâ€™s section of the belt with:
- Slots for the 3 cards currently on the belt
- A section below that for bots they have fixed this turn
- A pile for fixed bots from the entire round
- Point tracker for tracking points between rounds
- Cute styling like this is a mechanics desk 

Add a zero to the quota tracker lol


## 1/9/2025 - Player Mat Playtest

Feels really nice with the conveyor player mats to delineate the play space

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/PlayerMatEmpty.jpg" width="30%">
<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/PlayerMatCards.jpg" width="30%">

Q: What if everyone rolled for their section of the conveyor simultaneously?

<b>Pros</b>
- Game goes faster
- Fun chaos of everyone rolling dice simultaneously

<b>Cons</b>
- Less player investment for what other people are doing
- Push your luck is usually combined with spectatorship

Need to specify that the Swap action happens after the rolling phase

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/PlayerMatPlaytest.jpg" width="50%">

Q: What if <i>only</i> the first person to clear their conveyor line gets a bonus?
- Makes it more frantic
- Even more incentive to push your luck and go for all 3
- 5 dice instead of 4
- Ended up being much less strategic
- Fun and frantic but waaay more busts
- Loses some of the original strategy

Could be good to keep 4 dice and give a bonus to any/all player who complete their conveyor line completely 

### To Do:
- Think about asset styling 
- Work on some concepts for non-standard dice



## 1/23/2025 - Dice, Probability, Questions, Oh My!
 
Q: What if the dice had non-uniform probability distributions?
- Could there be a pool of dice you draft from
- Different types of dice?
- Robot types had different number preferences

Q: Should tools be separated from the robot cards?
- Could have a separate pile that is getting pulled from
- Dice you place there do no refresh back to you during the round
- Build up in a little desk tool box

Q: How do we give the player more agency in their robot selection?
- Double sided robot cards?!
	- Each robot card could have more than one type
- Simplify the Milk and Cookies pairs to 1 pair type

### To Do:
- Add multi color robot types to spreadsheet
- Playtest separate tool cards



## 1/27/2025 - Card Updates & Tools Implementation
 
- Added a second color type to the cards in the spreadsheet
- Updated the pairs to be simpler
	- Added a new all or nothing pair

### Playtest!
- Conveyor mechanic is still enjoyable
- EOD should probably not be swappable
- Tool slot feels really good
	- Itâ€™s fun to always have access to it
- Still maybe need more incentive to clear your full line
	- +1 point? Is that enough 

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ZoomPlaytestToolSlot.png" width="50%">

### To Do:
- Update Cards with second planned color
- Playtest to see if the daily quota makes sense again


## 1/31/2025 - Tools & Dice

### Playtest!
M: 21 points - 5b, 1r

Z: 23 points - 4y, 2r, 2g

- We may want to be more specific with the placement of the â€˜end of dayâ€™ card in the deckâ€™
- Paired cards probably shouldnâ€™t have a color
	- May need to add more 2 dice cards
- Daily quota is still pretty close in numbers
	- Could roll a quota die per roundâ€¦
	- Daily AND weekly quota?
- Thatâ€™s pretty clever die that allows you to take something someone else has rolled?

- Maybe tools are separate from the cards?
	- Tool die?
		- Per round?
		- Per turn? Up to a max of 3
	- If tools stay as cards they could have different die requirements: 1s & 2s, <3, etc.

- Could do something with the 1 die cards where having the most of them is worth points instead of them individually

### To Do:
- Think about tool dice options
- Redistribute colors to the new set of cards
	- And print them?

## 2/3/2025 - Card Reprint

- Updated the card distribution and reprinted some of them!

### Playtest!
- Distributed the EOD card into a set of 3 cards below ~18 cards
	- 2 players x 3 cards x 3 rounds = 18
- Rolling the tool die each turn is very fun
- Having the single die cards back in the deck speeds the game back up and felt really good!

M: 9 points - 1R, 1G
- 3 singles

Z: 15 points - 1R, 1G, 1Y
- 5 singles

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ZoomPlaytestToolDice.png" width="50%">

- Curious to play through more than 1 round and see how the single cards getting removed from the deck overtime feels


## 2/6/2025 - Review Playtest
- Want to play 2 rounds of the game as is and see how the gameplay feels and the points are distributed

### Playtest!
#### Round 1

Z: 10pt - 0R 0Y 1G 1B - 2 singles - 1 bonus

M: 6pt - 0R 0Y 0G 0B - 2 singles - 1 bonus

- Could be interesting if the singles AND the pairs stay out between rounds

#### Round 2

Z: 7pt - 3R 0Y 0G 0B - 1 singles - 0 bonus

M: 10pt - 0R 0Y 0G 1B - 3 singles - 2 bonus

#### Totals:

Z: 17pt - 3 singles - 1 bonus - Quota Bonus

M: 17pt - 5 singles - 3 bonus

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ZoomPlaytest_2-6.png" width="50%">

- Not as much choice for choosing robots by color or pair
- Maybe reduce singles back down to 12 in the deck?

## 2/10/2025 - Tool Dice Playtest
- EOD card distributed into 3 cards below (# Players + 1) x 3 cards

### Playtest!

#### Round 1

Z: 8pt - 0R 1Y 0G 0B - 1A & 2B	0 singles - 0 bonus

M: 8pt - 2R 0Y 0G 1B - 0A & 0B	1 singles - 0 bonus

- Wild tool die shouldnâ€™t return dice during that turn to keep rerolling
- When should points be scored for pairs and bonuses?

#### Round 2

Z: 11pt - 0R 2Y 0G 0B - 2A & 1B - 3 singles - 1 bonus

M: 14pt - 0R 1Y 0G 0B - 0A & 1B - 0 singles - 0 bonus

#### Totals:

Z: 19pt - 3A & 3B - 3 singles - 1 bonus = 26pt + Quota Bonus + Singles Bonus

M: 22pt - 0A & 1B - 1 singles - 0 bonus = 22pts

- Shuffle feels good for player agency
- Love the customized tool dice :)

<img src="https://github.com/mouseandthebillionaire/LDFD/blob/main/Process/Media/ToolDicePrototype.jpg" width="50%">

- Additional conveyor spot not in front of a player was nice
- Color on robots doesnâ€™t feel as impactful
	- Could be worth removing?
- Keeping the pairs between rounds is nice
- It might be nice to have something that ramps up each round to make the game have a more distinct progression
	- Each round you add a die?
	- Personal dice that have different distributions?
	- Worth trying for next time


## 2/13/2025 - Types or No Types Playtest
- What if there werenâ€™t any color types on robots?

### Playtest!
- Seems like it mostly reduces the reason to shuffle cards aroundâ€¦

#### Round 1

Z: 9pt - 0A & 0B - 1 singles - 0 bonus

M: 10pt - 0A & 1B - 1 singles - 0 bonus

- Maybe instead of one of the rerolls, there should be a tool that saves you from busting if you roll incorrectly and allows you to walk away with what youâ€™ve already fixed
- Color types are probably worth keeping
	- What if EVERY card had a color instead

#### Specialty Dice!
- The idea being that each round you specialize in a certain way of fixing robots, so you either replace or are adding specialty dice to your rolling pool
- Need to brainstorm more specialty dice here
	- Oops all 4s where there are 5 sides of 4 and 1 side of nothing XD
- Try out some of these mixed in with normal dice next time
